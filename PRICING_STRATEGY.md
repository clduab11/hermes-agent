## 🎯 Pricing Psychology & Strategy

### Why $499/month for Professional?

1. **Anchoring:** Just under $500 feels significantly cheaper than $500+
2. **Value perception:** $499/month = $16.63/day = less than one billable hour
3. **Competitor comparison:**
   - Virtual receptionist services: $500-$2,000/month (limited hours, per-minute billing)
   - Full-time receptionist: $3,000-$5,000/month (salary + benefits)
   - HERMES at $499 = 90% cheaper than receptionist, comparable to virtual service but 24/7

4. **ROI justification:** One additional case pays for 2+ years of service

### Why $1,999/month for Enterprise?

1. **4X pricing ladder:** Psychological multiplier (2x would be too close, 5x too far)
2. **Value alignment:** Multi-location firms save $100K+ vs. traditional staffing
3. **Dedicated support justification:** Success manager adds $500-$1,000 in perceived value
4. **Enterprise expectations:** Firms expect to pay $1,500-$3,000 for "enterprise" software

### Annual Discount Strategy

**20% discount (2 months free) when paid annually**

**Benefits:**
- **Cash flow:** Collect 10 months of revenue upfront
- **Lower churn:** Annual customers are stickier (87% renewal vs. 60% monthly)
- **Predictable revenue:** Easier to forecast and plan
- **Sales efficiency:** Larger deal sizes mean fewer transactions

**Expected uptake:** 40% of customers choose annual
