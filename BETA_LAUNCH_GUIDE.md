## 🎯 Beta Customer Criteria

### Ideal Beta Partner Profile

**Must Have:**
- ✅ Uses Clio CRM (for integration testing)
- ✅ 2-10 attorneys (sweet spot for value demonstration)
- ✅ Receives 50+ calls/month (enough data to show impact)

## 📋 Beta Outreach Playbook

### Week 1: Build Target List (Days 1-7)

**Goal:** Identify 20 potential beta firms

**Sources:**
1. **Personal Network (5 firms)** - Warm intros, highest conversion
2. **LinkedIn Search (10 firms)** - Cold but targeted
3. **Clio User Groups (3 firms)** - Community forums, Facebook groups
4. **Reddit r/LawFirm (2 firms)** - Active community of solo/small firm attorneys

---

### Source 1: Personal Network (Warm Intros)

**Step 1: List Connections**
- Review LinkedIn connections for attorneys
- Check college/law school alumni networks
- Ask friends/family for introductions
- Review past clients (if any legal professionals)

**Step 2: Outreach Script (Email)**

**Subject:** Quick question about your law practice

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I've been working on something that made me think of you.

Quick question: Does your firm lose potential clients who call after hours?

I ask because I've built an AI voice agent specifically for law firms. It's called HERMES, and it answers calls 24/7, conducts intake, and syncs to Clio CRM - all automatically.

We're looking for 3 beta partners to test it out before we launch publicly. The offer is pretty incredible:
- 60-day free trial (no credit card required)
- Then $299/month for 6 months (regular price is $499)
- White-glove setup and support

The only "catch" is we'd love your feedback and a testimonial if it works well.

Interested in a 15-minute call to see if it's a fit?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - I recorded a 2-minute demo: [video link]. Worth a quick watch if you have time.

### Source 2: LinkedIn Search (Cold Outreach)

**Step 1: Search Criteria**

**LinkedIn Search Filters:**

- Company size: 2-10 employees
- Location: [Your target cities - start local]
- Industry: Law Practice
- Look for: Active on LinkedIn (posts regularly), Clio user (mentions in profile)

**Step 2: Research Before Outreach (5 minutes per prospect)**
- Review their profile for practice area
- Check recent posts/activity
- Look for mutual connections
- Find a personalization hook (recent win, article, etc.)

**Step 3: LinkedIn Connection Request (Personalized)**

Hi [Name],

### Source 4: Reddit r/LawFirm

**Post Template:**

**Title:** "Built an AI receptionist for law firms - looking for 3 beta testers"

**Body:**

Hey r/LawFirm,

Solo PI attorney here. I got tired of losing after-hours calls, so I built an AI voice agent called HERMES that handles 24/7 client intake.

It's worked really well for me (captured 12 additional cases in 3 months that would've been voicemails), so I'm opening it up to a few other firms as beta testers.

**The offer:**
- 2 months completely free (no CC required)
- Then $299/month for 6 months (half off regular price)
- I'll personally help you set it up

**What it does:**
- Answers every call 24/7 (including weekends/holidays)
- Conducts intake conversation (sounds totally natural)
- Captures case details and contact info
- Syncs to Clio CRM automatically
- Books consultations based on your calendar

**What I'm looking for:**
- 3 firms willing to test it out and provide feedback
- Preferably using Clio (easier integration)
- Getting at least 50 calls/month

If you're interested, comment or DM me and I'll send you a demo video.

Happy to answer any questions!

## 📞 Discovery Call Script (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Qualify prospect, demonstrate value, close for trial

---

### Introduction (2 minutes)

"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time! Before I show you HERMES, tell me a bit about your practice. What areas of law do you focus on?"

[Listen actively, take notes]

---

### Problem Discovery (5 minutes)

**Question 1:** "Walk me through what happens when someone calls your firm at 8pm or on Saturday."

**Listen for:** Voicemail, missed opportunities, lost revenue

**Question 2:** "Do you have any idea how many after-hours calls you get per month?"

**Listen for:** Volume (need 50+ for good ROI), awareness of problem

**Question 3:** "Of the people who leave voicemails, what percentage actually get returned? And of those, how many convert to clients?"

**Listen for:** Low conversion on voicemails (usually 20-30%)

**Question 4:** "What's the average case value in your practice area?"

**Listen for:** High enough to justify ROI (ideally $10K+)

**Question 5:** "Have you ever calculated how much revenue you're losing from missed calls?"

**Listen for:** If they have, they're already problem-aware (easier sell). If not, help them calculate:

**Quick ROI Calculation:**
- 100 after-hours calls/month
- 67% won't leave voicemail = 67 lost opportunities
- If just 5% convert (3.35 cases) at $50K avg = $167,500/year in lost revenue
- HERMES costs $5,988/year
- ROI = 2,698%

---

### Solution Presentation (5 minutes)

"This is exactly why we built HERMES. Let me show you how it works..."

**Demo Options:**

**Option A: Live Call Demo (Best)**
- Call HERMES demo number in front of prospect
- Have them hear it answer, conduct intake
- Show how it captures data in Clio in real-time

**Option B: Recorded Video (Good)**
- Play 2-minute demo video
- Pause to explain key features
- Show Clio integration screenshots

**Option C: Screen Share (Okay)**
- Walk through dashboard
- Show call transcripts
- Demo analytics

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
1. ✅ "Answers in under 2 seconds - faster than any human receptionist"
2. ✅ "Sounds completely natural - clients don't realize it's AI"
3. ✅ "Syncs directly to Clio - no manual data entry"
4. ✅ "Works 24/7/365 - even holidays"
5. ✅ "Unlimited calls - no per-minute billing like virtual receptionists"

---

### Objection Handling (2 minutes)

**Objection 1: "Will clients trust AI?"**

**Response:**
"Great question - we were worried about that too. But here's what our beta users found: clients calling at 9pm aren't expecting a human anyway. They're just thrilled someone answered instead of voicemail.

Plus, the AI sounds so natural that most clients don't even realize. We've had zero complaints about it being 'robotic.'

And here's the key: you're not replacing your staff for business hours. This is just for after-hours and overflow. So it's AI vs. voicemail, not AI vs. human."

---

**Objection 2: "What about complex legal questions?"**

**Response:**
"HERMES doesn't give legal advice - and that's by design. It focuses on intake: name, contact info, case details, urgency. Then your attorneys review and prioritize.

Think of it like a triage nurse, not a doctor. It qualifies the lead and schedules the consultation where YOU provide the legal analysis.

For complex scenarios it can't handle, it gracefully says, 'That's a great question for [Attorney Name]. I have them available [date/time] for a consultation - does that work?'"

---

**Objection 3: "I'm worried about security and attorney-client privilege."**

**Response:**
"100% valid concern, and we take it very seriously. HERMES is:
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256)
- HIPAA-ready (for medical malpractice firms)
- Hosted in secure US-based data centers
- We never train our AI on your firm's data

Plus, intake conversations aren't typically privileged yet (no attorney-client relationship formed), but we treat everything as if it is."

---

**Objection 4: "I need to think about it / talk to my partners."**

**Response:**
"Totally understandable - this is a business decision. Let me make it easy:

The trial is completely free for 60 days. No credit card required. I'll set it up this week, forward your after-hours calls, and you can see exactly how many leads it captures.

If it doesn't pay for itself in new business, just cancel. But my bet is you'll see 5-10 additional leads in the first month alone.

How about we start the trial, and then you can show your partners real data when you have the conversation?"

---

### Close for Trial (1 minute)

"So here's what I'm thinking: Let's get you set up on a 60-day free trial this week. I'll personally handle the setup - takes about 10 minutes.

After the trial, you can lock in the beta pricing of $299/month for 6 months (half off the regular rate).

Only thing I ask: if it works well, would you be willing to do a quick testimonial or case study? We're trying to build credibility for our launch.

Sound fair?"

**If yes:**
"Awesome! I'm going to send you an onboarding email right now. Can you click the setup link and fill in your Clio API info? I'll have you live by [day/date]."

**If hesitant:**
"What would make you feel comfortable moving forward? Is it the time commitment, the technology, or something else?"
