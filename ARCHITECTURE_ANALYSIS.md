## Architectural Overview

### Design Patterns and Data Flow

**Chain of Thought Analysis**: Starting from the entry point, I'll trace the system architecture layer by layer to understand its design patterns and data flow.

#### 1. Core Architecture Pattern: Event-Driven Microservices
- **Purpose**: The system employs a hybrid monolithic-microservices architecture with event-driven communication
- **Implementation**: FastAPI main application (`main.py`) orchestrates specialized service modules
- **Dependencies**: Each module has clear separation of concerns with dependency injection patterns
- **Connections**: Services communicate via internal event streaming and external API integrations

#### 2. Voice Processing Pipeline (Primary Data Flow)
**Step-by-step analysis**:
1. **WebSocket Connection**: Client establishes persistent connection via `websocket_handler.py`
2. **Audio Ingestion**: Raw audio data flows through `voice_pipeline.py` 
3. **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper STT processes audio via `speech_to_text.py`
4. **AI Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4 generates contextual responses
5. **Text-to-Speech**: Kokoro TTS synthesizes audio via `text_to_speech.py`
6. **Response Delivery**: Processed audio returns through WebSocket connection

**Key Insight**: The pipeline maintains session state with conversation history (20-message limit) for contextual AI responses.

#### 3. Security Architecture (Multi-layered Defense)
**Analysis of security layers**:
- **Authentication Layer**: JWT-based auth with enterprise API key support (`auth/`)
- **Authorization Layer**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant isolation
- **Compliance Layer**: Built-in legal disclaimers and audit logging (`security/compliance_lockdown.py`)
- **Encryption Layer**: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest via secrets manager
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable throttling to prevent abuse

#### 4. Data Architecture (Multi-tenant with Audit Trail)
**Database layer analysis**:
- **Primary DB**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and async support (`database/`)
- **Caching**: Redis for session state and performance optimization (`cache/`)
- **Tenant Isolation**: Row-level security with tenant context management
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable logging for legal discovery requirements

#### 5. Integration Architecture (Enterprise-focused)
**External system connections**:
- **Clio Integration**: Legal CRM synchronization (`integrations/clio/`)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe enterprise billing (`billing/`)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics with GCP logging (`monitoring/`)
- **Analytics**: Custom analytics engine for practice insights (`analytics/`)

#### 6. Scalability Architecture (Cloud-native Design)
**Horizontal scaling patterns**:
- **Stateless Services**: FastAPI application designed for horizontal scaling
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed session state for multi-instance deployments
- **Load Balancing**: WebSocket-aware load balancing support
- **Resource Management**: Configurable audio processing limits and timeouts
