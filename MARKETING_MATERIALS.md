### Email Templates

#### Cold Outreach Email (Initial)

**Subject:** Missing after-hours calls at [Firm Name]?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Firm Name] specializes in [practice area] - congratulations on the [recent win/news/achievement].

Quick question: What happens when potential clients call your firm at 7pm? Or on Sunday?

Most firms lose 30-40% of after-hours calls to competitors. For a [practice area] practice, that's likely $500K-$1M+ in lost cases annually.

We built HERMES to solve this. It's an AI voice agent that:
• Answers every call 24/7/365 (even weekends and holidays)
• Conducts professional intake in natural conversation
• Qualifies leads and captures case details
• Syncs directly to Clio CRM
• Books consultations automatically

It costs $499/month - less than one billable hour.

Interested in a 10-minute demo? I have Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 11am available.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're offering the first 10 firms a 60-day free trial. Happy to get you set up this week.

---

#### Follow-Up Email (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Missing after-hours calls at [Firm Name]?

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from Tuesday. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

I recorded a 2-minute video showing HERMES handling a real client intake call: [LINK]

The firm in the video captured 12 additional cases in their first month - all from calls that would have gone to voicemail.

Worth a quick look?

[Your Name]

---

#### Follow-Up Email (Day 7 - Breakup)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now.

No problem at all - I'll close your file.

If timing changes and you want to stop missing calls, just reply to this email.

Otherwise, best of luck with your practice!

[Your Name]

P.S. - Out of curiosity, what's the biggest reason you're not interested? Always looking to improve our approach.

### Sales Script (Discovery Call)

**Opening (2 minutes):**
"Thanks for taking the time today, [Name]. I know your time is valuable. Before I jump in, can you tell me a bit about your practice? What areas of law do you focus on, and how big is your team?"

**Problem Discovery (5 minutes):**
- "Walk me through what happens when someone calls your firm at 8pm or on a Saturday."
- "Do you know how many after-hours calls you get per month?"
- "What percentage of voicemails actually get returned?"
- "Have you ever calculated how much revenue you lose from missed calls?"
- "What's the average case value in your practice area?"
- "If you could capture just 2-3 more cases per year, what would that be worth?"

**Solution Presentation (5 minutes):**
"This is exactly why we built HERMES. Let me show you how it works..."
[Demo: Play recorded intake call or do live demo]

**Objection Handling:**
- **"Will clients trust AI?"** - "Great question. Our beta firms report that clients don't even realize they're talking to AI - it sounds completely natural. And here's the key: clients calling at 9pm aren't expecting a human anyway. They're thrilled to get ANY response versus voicemail."

- **"What about complex cases?"** - "HERMES handles the initial intake - name, contact info, basic case details, urgency. Then your attorneys review and prioritize. Think of it as a filter, not a replacement."

- **"Security concerns?"** - "We're SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA-ready, and all data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We take attorney-client privilege very seriously."

**Closing (3 minutes):**
"Based on what you've told me about [X missed calls/month] and [Y practice area], you're likely losing [Z estimated revenue] annually. For $499/month, you could capture most of those. That's a 10X+ ROI minimum.

How about we do a 60-day trial? No credit card required. We'll set up HERMES this week, forward your after-hours calls, and see how many leads it captures. If it doesn't pay for itself in new business, just cancel. Sound fair?"

## 📧 Press Release

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**HERMES Launches AI-Powered Voice Agent to Help Law Firms Capture Every Client Call**

*Revolutionary 24/7 system answers calls, qualifies leads, and integrates with Clio CRM - for less than $20/day*

[CITY, STATE] - [DATE] - Parallax Analytics today announced the launch of HERMES, an AI-powered voice agent designed specifically for small and mid-size law firms. HERMES provides 24/7 client intake services, ensuring law firms never miss a potential case due to after-hours or overflow calls.

**The Problem:**
According to industry research, law firms lose 30-40% of after-hours calls to competitors, representing millions in lost revenue annually. The average personal injury case alone is worth $50,000-$250,000, meaning a single missed call can cost a firm six figures.

**The Solution:**
HERMES uses advanced AI and natural language processing to conduct professional client intake conversations that are indistinguishable from human receptionists. The system:
- Answers every call within 2 seconds, 24/7/365
- Conducts intelligent intake conversations in multiple languages
- Qualifies leads based on firm-specific criteria
- Integrates directly with Clio CRM and legal practice management systems
- Books consultations automatically based on attorney availability
- Follows up via email and SMS

**Pricing & Availability:**
HERMES is available starting at $499/month for unlimited calls - less than the cost of a single billable hour. A free tier supporting up to 100 calls/month is also available for solo practitioners.

"We built HERMES because we saw law firms literally losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in missed calls," said Chris [Last Name], Founder of Parallax Analytics. "A solo personal injury attorney missing just one good case per year is losing $100,000+. HERMES solves that for less than $20/day."

**Beta Results:**
Beta testing with three law firms showed:
- 98% call answer rate (vs. 60% with human receptionists)
- 40% increase in qualified leads
- Average ROI of 15:1 in first 90 days
- 4.8/5 client satisfaction rating

**Availability:**
HERMES is available immediately. Law firms can start a 60-day free trial at hermes.parallax-ai.app.

**About Parallax Analytics:**
Parallax Analytics builds AI-powered solutions for professional services. HERMES is the company's first product focused on the legal industry.
