# üéØ HERMES: Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Document Purpose**: This roadmap addresses GitHub Issue #59 by providing a reality-based implementation plan that builds on HERMES's existing production-ready foundation.

**Issue Context**: GitHub issue #59 proposes a comprehensive 10-sprint architectural roadmap based on the assumption that HERMES is in an early "foundation laid" state. However, comprehensive codebase analysis reveals that 70-80% of the proposed features are already implemented and production-ready.

**Strategic Approach**: Rather than rebuilding existing functionality, this roadmap focuses on genuine gaps and enhancement opportunities, delivering incremental value faster (4-6 weeks vs. 20 weeks) while maintaining lower risk.
