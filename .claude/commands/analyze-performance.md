Analyze performance implications of the current changes, specifically for HERMES voice pipeline:

1. **Voice Latency Impact**
   - Estimate latency impact (must stay <500ms)
   - Identify blocking operations
   - Check for sync code in async functions
   
2. **Database Queries**
   - Scan for N+1 query patterns
   - Check if indexes are needed
   - Verify connection pooling is used
   
3. **Memory Usage**
   - Identify potential memory leaks
   - Check for unbounded data structures
   - Verify proper cleanup of resources
   
4. **Async/Await Patterns**
   - Ensure all I/O is async
   - Check for event loop blocking
   - Verify proper use of asyncio primitives
   
5. **Caching Opportunities**
   - Identify frequently accessed data
   - Suggest Redis caching
   - Check for cache invalidation strategy
